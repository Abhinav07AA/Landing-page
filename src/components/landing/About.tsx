              The Uttar Pradesh Farm Equipment Management Portal is a government-backed initiative 
              dedicated to transforming the way farmers, FPOs, and aggregators manage and monetize 
              their farming equipment. Our mission is to empower the agricultural community of 
              Uttar Pradesh by providing a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly online marketplace 
              for listing and connecting over prime movers and implementers.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Our Vision</h3>
            <p>
              We envision a thriving agricultural ecosystem where every piece of equipment, whether 
              a tractor or a seeder, finds its purpose. By reducing idle resources and facilitating 
              seamless transactions, we aim to help boost farmers' incomes and drive sustainable 
              growth within the region.
